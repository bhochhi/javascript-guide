#### [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) principles:  
1. **Single source of truth**: Single immutable state tree representing the store(data) for your whole application
2. **State is read-only**: Dispatch an action to change the state. An action is  an object describing what happened.
3. **Changes are made with pure functions**: To specify how the state tree is transformed by actions, you write pure reducers.
